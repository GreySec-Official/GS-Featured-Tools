Get involved with the Open Source development of [WinRootHelper](https://github.com/GreySec-Security-Forums/WinRootHelper)

GS Devs is running a project in which you can get involved with. The purpose is to create a (post)exploitation tool in PowerShell 
That will make it easier for a security practioner, Red Team specifically, to get tool to a Windows system that will aid in UAC bypass and Privilege Escalation.

In principle it's based on on the Linux variant by the name of [RootHelper](https://github.com/NullArray/RootHelper).
